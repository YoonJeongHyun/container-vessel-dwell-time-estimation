# container-vessel-dwell-time-estimation
**Notice**
- This repository was created in order to keep open publicly the methods and data of estimation of vessel dwell time at a container terminal.
- All contents, codes and data shall not be used as commerce use, but only for purpose of research.
- And, it is less about the software code repository but more about storages for the data and codes I made for this study, so some codes may not work unless correcting details, such as file paths or imported libraries.
